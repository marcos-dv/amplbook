    "The most elementary kind of AMPL set is an unordered collection of character strings.\n",
    "Usually all of the strings in a set are intended to represent instances of the same kind of\n",
    "entity — such as raw materials, products, factories or cities. Often the strings are chosen\n",
    "to have recognizable meanings (`coils`, `FISH`, `New_York`), but they could just as well\n",
    "be codes known only to the modeler (`23RPFG`, `486/33C`). A literal string that appears\n",
    "in an AMPL model must be delimited by quotes, either single (`'A&P'`) or double\n",
    "(`\"Bell+Howell\"`). In all contexts, upper case and lower case letters are distinct, so\n",
    "that for example `\"fish\"`, `\"Fish\"`, and `\"FISH\"` represent different set members.\n",
    "\n",
    "The declaration of a set need only contain the keyword set and a name. For example,\n",
    "a model may declare\n",
    "```\n",
    "set PROD;\n",
    "```\n",
    "to indicate that a certain set will be referred to by the name `PROD` in the rest of the model.\n",
    "A name may be any sequence of letters, numerals, and underscore (_) characters that is\n",
    "not a legal number. A few names have special meanings in AMPL, and may only be used\n",
    "for specific purposes, while a larger number of names have predefined meanings that can\n",
    "be changed if they are used in some other way. For example, `sum` is reserved for the iterated\n",
    "addition operator; but `prod` is merely pre-defined as the iterated multiplication\n",
    "operator, so you can redefine prod as a set of products:\n",
    "```\n",
    "set prod;\n",
    "```\n",
    "A list of reserved words is given in Section A.1 xTODO.\n",
    "\n",
    "A declared set's membership is normally specified as part of the data for the model, in\n",
    "the manner to be described in Chapter 9 xTODO; this separation of model and data is recommended\n",
    "for most mathematical programming applications. Occasionally, however, it is\n",
    "desirable to refer to a particular set of strings within a model. A literal set of this kind is\n",
    "specified by listing its members within braces:\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\"bands\", \"coils\", \"plate\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "This expression may be used anywhere that a set is valid, for example in a model statement\n",
    "that gives the set PROD a fixed membership:\n",
    "```\n",
    "set PROD = {\"bands\", \"coils\", \"plate\"};\n",
    "```\n",
    "This sort of declaration is best limited to cases where a set's membership is small, is a\n",
    "fundamental aspect of the model, or is not expected to change often. Nevertheless we\n",
    "will see that the = phrase is often useful in set declarations, for the purpose of defining a\n",
    "set in terms of other sets and parameters. The operator `=` may be replaced by `default`\n",
    "to initialize the set while allowing its value to be overridden by a data statement or\n",
    "changed by subsequent assignments. These options are more important for parameters,\n",
    "however, so we discuss them more fully in Section 7.5 xTODO.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that AMPL makes a distinction between a string such as `\"bands\"` and a set\n",
    "like `{\"bands\"}` that has a membership of one string. The set that has no members (the\n",
    "empty set) is denoted `{}`."
