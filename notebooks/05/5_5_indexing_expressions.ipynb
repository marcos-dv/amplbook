    "In algebraic notation, the use of sets is indicated informally by phrases such as \"for\n",
    "all $i \\in P$ \" or \"`for t = 1, ..., T`\" or \"for all $j \\in C$ such that $c_j > 0$.\" The AMPL counterpart\n",
    "is the indexing expression that appears within braces `{ ... }` in nearly all of our examples.\n",
    "An indexing expression is used whenever we specify the set over which a model\n",
    "component is indexed, or the set over which a summation runs. Since an indexing\n",
    "expression defines a set, it can be used in any place where a set is appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest form of indexing expression is just a set name or expression within\n",
    "braces. We have seen this in parameter declarations such as these from the multiperiod\n",
    "production model of [Figure 4-4](../04/4_3_a_model_of_production_and_transportation.ipynb#fig-4-4):\n",
    "```\n",
    "param rate {PROD} > 0;\n",
    "param avail {1..T} >= 0;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Later in the model, references to these parameters are subscripted with a single set member,\n",
    "in expressions such as `avail[t]` and `rate[p]`. Variables can be declared and\n",
    "used in exactly the same way, except that the keyword `var` takes the place of `param`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The names such as `t` and `i` that appear in subscripts and other expressions in our\n",
    "models are examples of *dummy indices* that have been defined by indexing expressions.\n",
    "In fact, any indexing expression may optionally define a dummy index that runs over the\n",
    "specified set. Dummy indices are convenient in specifying bounds on parameters:\n",
    "```\n",
    "param f_min {FOOD} >= 0;\n",
    "param f_max {j in FOOD} >= f_min[j];\n",
    "```\n",
    "and on variables:\n",
    "```\n",
    "var Buy {j in FOOD} >= f_min[j], <= f_max[j];\n",
    "```\n",
    "They are also essential in specifying the sets over which constraints are defined, and the\n",
    "sets over which summations are done. We have often seen these uses together, in declarations\n",
    "such as\n",
    "```\n",
    "subject to Time {t in 1..T}:\n",
    "  sum {p in PROD} (1/rate[p]) * Make[p,t] <= avail[t];\n",
    "```\n",
    "and\n",
    "```\n",
    "subject to Diet_Min {i in MINREQ}:\n",
    "  sum {j in FOOD} amt[i,j] * Buy[j] >= n_min[i];\n",
    "```\n",
    "An indexing expression consists of an index name, the keyword `in`, and a set expression\n",
    "as before. We have been using single letters for our index names, but this is not a\n",
    "requirement; an index name can be any sequence of letters, digits, and underscores that is\n",
    "not a valid number, just like the name for a model component.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although a name defined by a model component's declaration is known throughout\n",
    "all subsequent statements in the model, the definition of a dummy index name is effective\n",
    "only within the *scope* of the defining indexing expression. Normally the scope is evident\n",
    "from the context. For instance, in the `Diet_Min` declaration above, the scope of `{i in\n",
    "MINREQ}` runs to the end of the statement, so that `i` can be used anywhere in the description\n",
    "of the constraint. On the other hand, the scope of `{j in FOOD}` covers only the\n",
    "summand `amt[i,j] * Buy[j]`. The scope of indexing expressions for sums and other\n",
    "iterated operators is discussed further in [Chapter 7](../07/07.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once an indexing expression's scope has ended, its dummy index becomes undefined.\n",
    "Thus the same index name can be defined again and again in a model, and in fact it is\n",
    "good practice to use relatively few different index names. A common convention is to\n",
    "associate certain index names with certain sets, so that for example `i` always runs over\n",
    "`NUTR` and `j` always runs over `FOOD`. This is merely a convention, however, not a restriction\n",
    "imposed by AMPL. Indeed, when we modified the diet model so that there was a\n",
    "subset `MINREQ` of `NUTR`, we used `i` to run over `MINREQ` as well as `NUTR`. The opposite\n",
    "situation occurs, for example, if we want to specify a constraint that the amount of each\n",
    "food `j` in the diet is at least some fraction `min_frac[j]` of the total food in the diet:\n",
    "```\n",
    "subject to Food_Ratio {j in FOOD}:\n",
    "  Buy[j] >= min_frac[j] * sum {jj in FOOD} Buy[jj];\n",
    "```\n",
    "Since the scope of `j` in FOOD extends to the end of the declaration, a different index `jj`\n",
    "is defined to run over the set `FOOD` in the summation within the constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a final option, the set in an indexing expression may be followed by a colon (`:`)\n",
    "and a logical condition. The indexing expression then represents only the subset of members\n",
    "that satisfy the condition. For example,\n",
    "```\n",
    "{j in FOOD: f_max[j] - f_min[j] < 1}\n",
    "```\n",
    "describes the set of all foods whose minimum and maximum amounts are nearly the\n",
    "same, and\n",
    "```\n",
    "{i in NUTR: i in MAXREQ or n_min[i] > 0}\n",
    "```\n",
    "describes the set of nutrients that are either in `MAXREQ` or for which `n_min` is positive.\n",
    "The use of operators such as `or` and `<` to form logical conditions will be fully explained\n",
    "in [Chapter 7](../07/07.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "By specifying a condition, an indexing expression defines a new set. You can use the\n",
    "indexing expression to represent this set not only in indexed declarations and summations,\n",
    "but anywhere else that a set expression may appear. For example, you could say\n",
    "either of\n",
    "```\n",
    "set NUTREQ = {i in NUTR: i in MAXREQ or n_min[i] > 0};\n",
    "set NUTREQ = MAXREQ union {i in MINREQ: n_min[i] > 0};\n",
    "```\n",
    "to define NUTREQ to represent our preceding example of a set expression, and you could\n",
    "use either of\n",
    "```\n",
    "set BOTHREQ = {i in MINREQ: i in MAXREQ};\n",
    "set BOTHREQ = MINREQ inter MAXREQ;\n",
    "```\n",
    "to define `BOTHREQ` to be the set of all nutrients that have both minimum and maximum\n",
    "requirements. It's not unusual to find that there are several ways of describing some\n",
    "complicated set, depending on how you combine set operations and indexing expression\n",
    "conditions. Of course, some possibilities are easier to read than others, so it's worth taking\n",
    "some trouble to find the most readable. In [Chapter 6](../06/06.md) we also discuss efficiency considerations\n",
    "that sometimes make one alternative preferable to another in specifying compound\n",
    "sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to being valuable within the model, indexing expressions are useful in\n",
    "`get_data` and `display` statements to summarize characteristics of the data or solution. The following\n",
    "example is based on the model of [Figure 5-1](../05/5_3_set_operations.ipynb#fig-5-1) and the data of [Figure 5-2](../05/5_3_set_operations.ipynb#fig-5-2):"
