    "A parameter declaration describes certain data required by a model, and indicates how\n",
    "the model will refer to data values in subsequent expressions.\n",

    "The simplest parameter declaration consists of the keyword param and a name:\n",
    "```\n",
    "param T;\n",
    "```\n",
    "At any point after this declaration, `T` can be used to refer to a numerical value.\n",

    "param avail {1..T};\n",
    "param demand {DEST,PROD};\n",
    "param revenue {p in PROD, AREA[p], 1..T};\n",
    "```\n",
    "One parameter is defined for each member of the set specified by the indexing\n",
    "expression. Thus a parameter is uniquely determined by its name and its\n",
    "associated set member; throughout the rest of the model, you would refer to\n",
    "this parameter by writing the name and bracketed \"subscripts\":\n",
    "```\n",
    "avail[i]\n",
    "demand[j,p]\n",
    "revenue[p,a,t]\n",
    "```\n",
    "If the indexing is over a simple set of objects as described in [Chapter 5](../05/05.md), there is one subscript.\n",
    "If the indexing is over a set of pairs, triples, or longer tuples as described in [Chapter 6](../06/06.md),\n",
    "there must be a corresponding pair, triple, or longer list of subscripts separated by\n",
    "commas. The subscripts can be any expressions, so long as they evaluate to members of\n",
    "the underlying index set.\n",
    "\n",
    "An unindexed parameter is a scalar value, but a parameter indexed over a simple set\n",

    "```\n",
    "param avail {1..T};\n",
    "```\n",
    "the individual subscripted parameters are `avail[1], avail[2], ... , avail[T]`, and\n",
    "there is an obvious analogy to the vectors of linear algebra, the arrays of a programming\n",
    "language like C. AMPL's concept of a vector is more general, however,\n",
    "since parameters may also be indexed over sets of strings, which need not even be\n",
    "ordered, more similar to what Python dictionaries look like.\n",
    "Indexing over sets of strings is best suited for parameters that correspond to\n",
    "places, products and other entities for which no numbering is especially natural. Indexing\n",
    "over sequences of numbers is more appropriate for parameters that correspond to weeks,\n",
    "stages, and the like, which by their nature tend to be ordered and numbered; even for\n",

    "set ORIG;\n",
    "set DEST;\n",
    "set LINKS within {ORIG,DEST};\n",
