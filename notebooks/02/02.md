# 2. Diet and Other Input Models: Minimizing Costs

To complement the profit-maximizing models of [Chapter 1](../01/01.md),
we now consider linear programming models in which
the objective is to minimize costs.  Where the constraints of
maximization models tend to be upper limits on the availability of
resources, the constraints in minimization models are more likely to be
lower limits on the amounts of certain "qualities" in the solution.

As an intuitive example of a cost-minimizing model,
this chapter uses the well-known "diet
problem", which finds a mix of foods that satisfies
requirements on the amounts of various vitamins.  We will again
construct a small, explicit linear program, and then show how
a general model can be formulated for all linear programs of that
kind.  Since you are now more familiar with `AMPL`,
however, we will spend more time on `AMPL` and less with algebraic notation.

After formulating the diet model, we will discuss
a few changes that might make it more realistic.  The full power of
this model, however, derives from its applicability to many situations
that have nothing to do with diets.  Thus we conclude this chapter by
rewriting the model in a more general way, and discussing its
application to blending, economics, and scheduling.
