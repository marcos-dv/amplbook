    "Your personal experience probably suggests that diet models are not\n",
    "widely used by people to choose their dinners.  These models would be\n",
    "much better suited to situations in which packaging and personal\n",
    "preferences don't play such a prominent role &ndash; for example, the blending of\n",
    "animal feed or perhaps food for college dining halls.\n",
    "\n",
    "The diet model is a convenient, intuitive example\n",
    "of a linear programming formulation that appears in many\n",
    "contexts.  Suppose that we rewrite the model in a more general way, as\n",
    "shown in Figure @Tut2@-@blend.mod@.\n",

    "can be amounts of something (sodium or calories for animal feed), or\n",

    "In another well-known application, the inputs are production activities\n",
    "of some sector of an economy, and the outputs are various products.  The\n",
    "`in_min`\n",
    "and\n",
    "`in_max`\n",
    "parameters are limits on the levels of the activities, while \n",
    "`out_min`\n",

    "`out_max`\n",
    "are regulated by demands.  Thus the goal is to find levels of the activities\n",
    "that meet demand at the lowest cost.  This interpretation is related to the\n",
    "concept of an economic equilibrium, as we will explain in Chapter @Complement@.\n",
    "\n",

    "The same approach can be used in a\n",
    "variety of other scheduling contexts, where the hours, days or months\n",
    "are replaced by other periods of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although linear programming can be very useful in applications\n",
    "like these, we need to keep in mind the assumptions that underlie\n",
    "the LP model.  We have already mentioned the \"continuity\" assumption\n",
    "whereby\n",

    "is allowed to take on any value between\n",

    "This may be a lot more reasonable for blending than for\n",
    "scheduling.\n",
    "\n",
    "As another example, in writing the objective as\n",
    "```\n",
    "sum {j in INPUT} cost[j] * X[j]\n",
    "```\n",
    "we are assuming \"linearity of costs\", that is,\n",
    "that the cost of an input is proportional to\n",
    "the amount of the input used, and that the total cost is the sum of the\n",
    "inputs' individual costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In writing the constraints as\n",
    "```\n",
    "out_min[i] <= sum {j in INPUT} io[i,j] * X[j] <= out_max[i]\n",
    "```\n",
    "we are also assuming that the yield of an\n",
    "output\n",
    "`i`\n",
    "from a particular input is proportional to the amount of the\n",
    "input used, and that the total yield of an output\n",
    "`i`\n",
    "is the sum of the\n",
    "yields from the individual inputs.  This \"linearity of yield\"\n",
    "assumption poses no problem when the inputs are schedules,\n",
    "and the outputs are hours worked.  But in the blending\n",
    "example, linearity is a physical assumption about the nature of the\n",
    "raw materials and the qualities,\n",
    "which may or may not hold.  In early applications to refineries, for\n",
    "example, it was recognized that the addition of lead as an input had a\n",
    "nonlinear effect on the quality known as octane rating in the resulting\n",
    "blend.\n",
    "\n",
    "`AMPL` makes it easy to express discrete\n",
    "or nonlinear models, but any departure from continuity or linearity\n",
    "is likely to make an optimal\n",
