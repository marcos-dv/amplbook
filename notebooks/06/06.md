# 6. Compound Sets and Indexing

Most linear programming models involve indexing over combinations of members
from several different sets. Indeed, the interaction of indexing sets is often the most complicated
aspect of a model; once you have the arrangement of sets worked out, the rest of
the model can be written clearly and concisely.

All but the simplest models employ compound sets whose members are pairs, triples,
quadruples, or even longer "tuples" of objects. This chapter begins with the declaration
and use of sets of ordered pairs. We concentrate first on the set of all pairs from two sets,
then move on to subsets of all pairs and to "slices" through sets of pairs. Subsequent
sections explore sets of longer tuples, and extensions of AMPL's set operators and indexing
expressions to sets of tuples.

The final section of this chapter introduces sets that are declared in collections
indexed over other sets. An indexed collection of sets often plays much the same role as
a set of tuples, but it represents a somewhat different way of thinking about the formulation.
Each kind of set is appropriate in certain situations, and we offer some guidelines
for choosing between them.
