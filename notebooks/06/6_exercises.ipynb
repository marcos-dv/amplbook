    "```\n",
    "set DEMAND = {j in DEST, p in PROD: demand[j,p] > 0};\n",
    "```\n",
    "and index the variables over `{ORIG,DEMAND}`, so that variables are defined only where they\n",

    "set LINKS within {ORIG,DEST};\n",
    "set TRANSF = {i1 in ORIG, i2 in ORIG: i1 <> i2};\n",
    "```\n",
    "Define variables over LINKS to represent shipments to destinations, and over TRANSF to represent\n",
    "shipments between origins. The constraint at each origin now must say that total shipments\n",
    "out — to other origins as well as to destinations — must equal supply plus shipments in from other\n",
    "origins. Complete the formulation for this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6-8.** Reformulate the model from Exercise 3-3(b) so that it uses a set LINK1 of allowable plantmill\n",

    "`ppref[r,p]` would be the preference of referee r for paper p, and `Review[r,p]` would be 1\n",

    "preferences of all assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\(c) Unfortunately, you don't have the referees' preferences for individual papers, since they haven't\n",
